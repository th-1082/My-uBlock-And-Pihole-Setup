Title: TH-1082 YouTube Spam Comments

! I have noticed a sharp rise in spam comments on YouTube. This list uses regex
! to remove nearly all YT link spam as well as 18+ site spam links from comment
! sections. I plan to expand this list dramatically and make it impossible to
! circumvent by spammers. Regex FTW
