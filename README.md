# Welcome to My Adblocking Filter Repository
This repository is used to give myself a convenient way to store and access my custom filters for uBO and my Pihole setup.

# General Information
Since these filters were created for myself to use, I will not remove any filters that negatively impact those that use them unless I feel as though they aren't worth keeping. <em>Use these filters at your own risk</em>

The "Hosts" folder contains hosts-formatted files that work with Pihole, but it can also be used with browser-based adblockers. The "UBO & ABP" folder contains many more filter lists and work well with browser based adblockers.

# Lists and Their Purposes
This section temporarily removed.
